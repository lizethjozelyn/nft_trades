# NFT Trading Simulator

## Available Scripts


To run the API needed for the webabb to work, run:

### `node api.js`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Within the client directory to start the app. If it does not work due to "react-scripts" missing, then run

`npm install react-scripts --save`

to fix it.

Note that you need the config file with the MySQL server info to run this project. The config file should be placed in /server/config. Config file is available upon request - for security reasons, it cannot be uploaded to GitHub
